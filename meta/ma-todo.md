# MA Status

## ToDo
### Research
- graph transformations, see [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3331543.3342576?casa_token=W4NraPsp50QAAAAA:iujvhbGvAbIDUmbFgnracqGDEyWlNHWxBtCvcl1viX4O8JKsIqsXHuxiQ0Nqzw6gZM0sH8YUXVq3)
- "hacked" evolutionary transformations to spice things up? (like: symbol switching, drop out)
- learn probabilities from call probabilities, see [this video series](https://youtu.be/2hLBHSKbS44)
- evaluation method? -> Bastus, Martin
### Technical
- implement two side expanding grammar
- recursively apply grammars?

## Notes
### Cognitive Linguistics (Ron Langacker)
- cognitive grammar 
  - [Lawrence Zbikowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2XKzCQ_Uj4)
  - music = form of communication, communication = rather social / anthropological process than just information theoretic one
  - relation of music and gesture @ 18:04 ff.
- theoretic deliberations
  - see what [Martin Hilpert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDfX3971Z_A)@28:13 wrote about cognitive grammars
  - compare Langacker's terminology (especially units) to set / category theory (maybe talk to some profs)
  - check out fusions of cognitive grammar and computer science
- possibilities
  - difficult, but if successful: incorporate notion of "form and function" into current approach
  - music relates to gesture -> find possible related (abstract) gestures and answer them
