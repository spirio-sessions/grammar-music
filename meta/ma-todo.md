# MA Status

## ToDo
### Technical
- play with non-deterministic, multiple-way-expanding grammars
- implement motivic transformations (mirroring, cancer, etc.)
- graph rendering -> jpg (or other pixel format) for thesis export
### Experiments
- rest-separated: rearranging fixed sections

## Notes
### Cognitive Linguistics (Ron Langacker)
- cognitive grammar 
  - [Lawrence Zbikowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2XKzCQ_Uj4)
  - music = form of communication, communication = rather social / anthropological process than just information theoretic one
  - relation of music and gesture @ 18:04 ff.
- theoretic deliberations
  - see what [Martin Hilpert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDfX3971Z_A)@28:13 wrote about cognitive grammars
  - compare Langacker's terminology (especially units) to set / category theory (maybe talk to some profs)
  - check out fusions of cognitive grammar and computer science
- possibilities
  - difficult, but if successful: incorporate notion of "form and function" into current approach
  - music relates to gesture -> find possible related (abstract) gestures and answer them
