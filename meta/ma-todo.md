# MA Status

## ToDo
### Technical
- reduce overall velocity by factor (+ ui settable)
- rests ignored in felix-intervallic (fix?)
- do not delete rests in building blocks
- make resilient, in case of failure: restart
- separation indicator between call & response in debug midi play
- add same replay functionality as in debug midi to grammar music (replay button next to comment input)
- rename and give proper route to debug midi
- add reversed doubling, establish relations through transformations
- add zoom to tree view
- max midi synth setting -> no sustain
- implement harmonic transformation cancer aka vertical flip for sequence of tones
- graph rendering -> jpg (or other pixel format) for thesis export
### Experiments
- new felix grammars

## Notes
### Cognitive Linguistics (Ron Langacker)
- cognitive grammar 
  - [Lawrence Zbikowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2XKzCQ_Uj4)
  - music = form of communication, communication = rather social / anthropological process than just information theoretic one
  - relation of music and gesture @ 18:04 ff.
- theoretic deliberations
  - see what [Martin Hilpert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDfX3971Z_A)@28:13 wrote about cognitive grammars
  - compare Langacker's terminology (especially units) to set / category theory (maybe talk to some profs)
  - check out fusions of cognitive grammar and computer science
- possibilities
  - difficult, but if successful: incorporate notion of "form and function" into current approach
  - music relates to gesture -> find possible related (abstract) gestures and answer them
