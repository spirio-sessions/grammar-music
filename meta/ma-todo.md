## Literature Summary
- Roads1979, Grammars as Representations for Music: overview paper, root of research
- Roads1978, Composing Grammars: composing whole pieces with grammar, abstract grammar + lexical mapping
- Winograd1968, Linguistics and Computer Analysis of Tonal Harmony: analysing pieces with systemic grammars, Forte's harmony principles implied
- Baroni1983, The Concept of Musical Grammar: model melody by transformation of intervallic contour

## ToDo
### Research
- research / figure out method for transformations and their adaption
  - classic AST transformations -> dragon book
  - "hacked" evolutionary transformations (like: symbol switching, drop out)
- learn probabilities from call probabilities, see [this video series](https://youtu.be/2hLBHSKbS44)
### Technical
- implement two side expanding grammar
- recursively apply grammars?

## Notes
### Cognitive Linguistics (Ron Langacker)
- cognitive grammar 
  - [Lawrence Zbikowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2XKzCQ_Uj4)
  - music = form of communication, communication = rather social / anthropological process than just information theoretic one
  - relation of music and gesture @ 18:04 ff.
- theoretic deliberations
  - see what [Martin Hilpert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDfX3971Z_A)@28:13 wrote about cognitive grammars
  - compare Langacker's terminology (especially units) to set / category theory (maybe talk to some profs)
  - check out fusions of cognitive grammar and computer science
- possibilities
  - difficult, but if successful: incorporate notion of "form and function" into current approach
  - music relates to gesture -> find possible related (abstract) gestures and answer them
